# CDISC CRF Generator

This project provides tools for generating Case Report Forms (CRFs) using metadata from the CDISC Library.

Additional documentation is available in the [docs](docs/) directory, including an [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) about accessing and using the CDISC Library.

Utility helpers such as `cdisc_library_client.normalize_headers()` are provided
to sanitize HTTP headers before requests are made. This avoids issues when
secrets are supplied as bytes.

## Generating CDASH CRFs

The repository includes `scripts/generate_cdash_crf.py` which converts the
official CDASH workbooks into Word documentsâ€”one per domain.  The script now
includes extra metadata from the IG such as variable type, any controlled
terminology and completion instructions.  It requires `pandas`, `python-docx`
and `openpyxl` which are already listed in the project dependencies.

```bash
python scripts/generate_cdash_crf.py \
    --model CDASH_Model_v1.3.xlsx \
    --ig CDASHIG_v2.3.xlsx \
    --out ./crfs

# To build only specific domains
python scripts/generate_cdash_crf.py --model CDASH_Model_v1.3.xlsx \
    --ig CDASHIG_v2.3.xlsx --domains AE CM
```

Edit `build_domain_crf()` in the script to customise the table layout or add
study branding.
