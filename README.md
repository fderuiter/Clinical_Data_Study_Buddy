# CDISC Generators

![Weekly Sync Status](https://github.com/fderuiter/cdisc_generators/actions/workflows/weekly-sync.yml/badge.svg)

This project provides tools for generating Case Report Forms (CRFs) using metadata from the CDISC Library.

Additional documentation is available in the [docs](docs/) directory, including an [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) about accessing and using the CDISC Library.

Utility helpers such as `cdisc_library_client.normalize_headers()` are provided
to sanitize HTTP headers before requests are made. This avoids issues when
secrets are supplied as bytes.


## Quickstart

Follow these steps to set up the project and generate your first set of CRF artifacts.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fderuiter/cdisc_generators.git
    cd cdisc_generators
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**
    This project uses Poetry for dependency management. Make sure you have Python 3.11+ and Poetry installed.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3.  **Configure your CDISC Library API Key:**
    You will need a primary subscription key from the CDISC Library. Once you have it, export it as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export CDISC_PRIMARY_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

4.  **Fetch the canonical CRF data:**
    This command crawls the CDISC Library and creates a canonical `crf.json` file.
    ```bash
    poetry run cdisc build-canonical -o crf.json
    ```

5.  **Generate all CRF artifacts:**
    This command reads the `crf.json` file and generates the CRF documents in multiple formats (Markdown, DOCX, CSV, etc.) inside the `artefacts/` directory.
    ```bash
    poetry run cdisc build --source crf.json --outdir artefacts
    ```

6.  **View the generated files:**
    The generated artifacts are now in the `artefacts/` directory. You can open them to see the results. For example, on macOS, you could run:
    ```bash
    open artefacts/VS.docx
    ```

## Web UI (New)

This project also includes a web-based user interface for generating datasets.

To run the UI, use the following command:
```bash
poetry run uvicorn src.ui.main:app --reload
```

Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
## Development Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Setup scripts are provided for different operating systems.

### Linux and macOS

Run the setup script from your shell:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
1.  Check for `python3` (3.11+) and `poetry`.
2.  If they are not found, it will attempt to install them using the system's package manager (`apt`, `yum`, or `brew`).
3.  Install all project dependencies.
4.  Set up pre-commit hooks.

### Windows

Run the PowerShell setup script from a PowerShell terminal. You may need to adjust your execution policy first:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
./setup.ps1
```

The script will:
1.  Check for Python 3.11+ and Poetry.
2.  If they are not found, it will download and install them. This may require administrator privileges.
3.  Install all project dependencies.
4.  Set up pre-commit hooks.
> **Note:** If Python or Poetry are installed by the script, you will need to restart your terminal and run the script again for the changes to take effect.

### Docker-based Environment (Recommended)

For the most consistent and reliable setup, you can use the provided development container. This avoids any "works on my machine" issues.

## Updating the CDISC Library API Client

This project includes a generated Python client for the CDISC Library API located in `src/cdisc_library_client`. This client is generated from the official CDISC Library OpenAPI specification.

To update the client to the latest version, you can use the following command:

```bash
make update-sdk
```

This command will:
1.  Download the latest OpenAPI specification from the official CDISC website.
2.  Regenerate the Python client in `src/cdisc_library_client`.

It is recommended to run this command periodically to ensure the client is up-to-date with any changes to the CDISC Library API.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [VS Code Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

**To get started:**
1.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
2.  A notification will appear asking if you want to "Reopen in Container". Click it.
3.  VS Code will build the Docker image and start the development container. This may take a few minutes on the first run.

Once inside the dev container, you'll have a fully configured environment with all tools and dependencies ready to go. You can use the integrated terminal in VS Code to run tests, scripts, etc.

## Generating CDASH CRFs

The repository includes a command to convert the official CDASH workbooks into Word documentsâ€”one per domain.  The command now adds extra metadata from the IG such as variable type, controlled terminology and completion instructions.  Generated CRFs use a consistent landscape layout with protocol information in the header and versioned footers with page numbers.

```bash
poetry run cdisc generate-cdash-crf --ig-version v2.3 --out ./crfs

# To build only specific domains
poetry run cdisc generate-cdash-crf --ig-version v2.3 --domains AE CM --out ./crfs
```

## Generating Analysis Code

This project can also generate analysis code in SAS and R for various outputs.

### Quickstart

To generate an analysis script, use the `generate-analysis` command. For example, to generate a SAS script for a demographics table from the ADSL dataset, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run cdisc generate-analysis \
    --language sas \
    --dataset ADSL \
    --output-type demographics \
    --treatment-var TRT01A \
    --output-file demog_table.sas
```

This will generate a SAS file named `demog_table.sas` in the current directory.

## Generating Synthetic Datasets

In addition to generating CRFs from the CDISC Library, this project can also generate synthetic CDISC-compliant datasets using the cdiscdataset.com API.

### Quickstart

To generate a synthetic dataset, use the `generate-synthetic-data` command. For example, to generate an SDTM dataset for the DM domain, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run cdisc generate-synthetic-data \
    --dataset-type SDTM \
    --domain DM \
    --num-subjects 100 \
    --output-dir ./synthetic_data
```

This will generate a CSV file in the `synthetic_data` directory.


## Generating EDC Raw Dataset Package

This project includes a command to generate a complete package of raw EDC datasets for a clinical study. The command, `generate-raw-dataset-package`, generates a ZIP file containing multiple datasets with consistent subjects across all domains. It also includes a draft `define.xml` file (currently with limited metadata).

### Quickstart

To generate a raw dataset package, use the `generate-raw-dataset-package` command. For example, to generate a package with DM, VS, and LB domains for 10 subjects in the Oncology therapeutic area, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run cdisc generate-raw-dataset-package \
    --num-subjects 10 \
    --domains DM --domains VS --domains LB \
    --therapeutic-area Oncology \
    --output-dir ./raw_dataset_package
```

This will generate a `edc_raw_datasets.zip` file in the `raw_dataset_package` directory.

## Generating Study Protocols

This project can also generate study protocol documents. This feature is useful for creating a quick draft of a protocol based on a few key parameters.

### Quickstart

To generate a study protocol, use the `protocol generate` command:

```bash
poetry run cdisc protocol generate \
    --therapeutic-area "Oncology" \
    --treatment-arm "Drug A + Placebo" \
    --treatment-arm "Drug B + Placebo" \
    --duration-weeks 52 \
    --phase 3 \
    --output-dir "my_protocol"
```

This will generate a `protocol.md` file and a `gantt_chart.png` file in the `my_protocol` directory.

## Specification Management

This project provides tools to generate and validate dataset specifications.

### Generating an Excel Specification

You can generate an Excel-based specification template for a given CDISC product and version.

```bash
poetry run cdisc spec generate-template --product sdtmig --version 3-3 --domains DM --domains AE --domains VS
```

This will create a file named `sdtmig_3-3_spec.xlsx` with sheets for the DM, AE, and VS domains.

### Generating a Dataset from a Specification

Once you have a specification file, you can generate a synthetic dataset from it.

```bash
poetry run cdisc spec generate-dataset --spec-file sdtmig_3-3_spec.xlsx
```

This will generate CSV files for each domain (sheet) in the specification file.

### Validating a Dataset Against a Specification

You can also validate an existing dataset against a specification file.

```bash
poetry run cdisc spec validate --spec-file sdtmig_3-3_spec.xlsx --dataset-file sdtm_dm_20250822_215518.csv
```

This will check for missing/extra columns and data type mismatches.

## Generating Reviewer's Guides

This project includes commands to generate an Analysis Data Reviewer's Guide (ADRG) and a Study Data Reviewer's Guide (SDRG). These guides are based on the PHUSE templates and are intended for FDA submissions.

### Prerequisites

Before generating the reviewer's guides, you need to have a `crf.json` file and a `study_config.json` file.

- The `crf.json` file can be generated by running `poetry run cdisc build-canonical`.
- The `study_config.json` file should be created manually and should contain study-specific information. See the example below:

```json
{
  "study_id": "ABC-123",
  "protocol_id": "XYZ-001",
  "protocol_title": "A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of a New Drug"
}
```

### Generating the ADRG

To generate the ADRG, use the `adrg generate` command:

```bash
poetry run cdisc adrg generate \
    --crf crf.json \
    --config study_config.json \
    --out adrg.docx
```

### Generating the SDRG

To generate the SDRG, use the `sdrg generate` command:

```bash
poetry run cdisc sdrg generate \
    --crf crf.json \
    --config study_config.json \
    --out sdrg.docx
```

## OpenFDA Integration

This project includes features to integrate data from [open.fda.gov](https://open.fda.gov/) to enrich the generated CRFs.

### Populating CRFs with Adverse Event Data

You can automatically populate the Adverse Events (AE) CRF with suggested terms for a specific drug. The `generate-cdash-crf` command has a new option to support this:

```bash
poetry run cdisc generate-cdash-crf \
    --ig-version v2.3 \
    --domains AE \
    --openfda-drug-name "Aspirin" \
    --openfda-max-results 50
```

This will fetch the top 50 most frequently reported adverse events for Aspirin from OpenFDA and add them to a separate table in the generated `AE_Adverse_Events_CRF.docx` document, providing a useful reference for common adverse events.

### Standalone OpenFDA Command

For more advanced queries, you can use the `openfda populate-crf` command. This command allows you to fetch adverse events or drug labeling information and output it in various formats.

**Examples:**

Fetch adverse events for a drug and save as JSON:
```bash
poetry run cdisc openfda populate-crf \
    --drug-name "Ibuprofen" \
    --domain AE \
    --max-results 100 \
    --output-format json > ibuprofen_aes.json
```

Fetch drug label information for a drug:
```bash
poetry run cdisc openfda populate-crf \
    --drug-name "Tylenol" \
    --domain LABEL
```
