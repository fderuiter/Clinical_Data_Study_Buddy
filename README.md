# CDISC CRF Generator

![Weekly Sync Status](https://github.com/fderuiter/cdisc_crf_generator/actions/workflows/weekly-sync.yml/badge.svg)

This project provides tools for generating Case Report Forms (CRFs) using metadata from the CDISC Library.

Additional documentation is available in the [docs](docs/) directory, including an [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) about accessing and using the CDISC Library.

Utility helpers such as `cdisc_library_client.normalize_headers()` are provided
to sanitize HTTP headers before requests are made. This avoids issues when
secrets are supplied as bytes.


## Quickstart

Follow these steps to set up the project and generate your first set of CRF artifacts.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fderuiter/cdisc_crf_generator.git
    cd cdisc_crf_generator
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**
    This project uses Poetry for dependency management. Make sure you have Python 3.11+ and Poetry installed.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3.  **Configure your CDISC Library API Key:**
    You will need a primary subscription key from the CDISC Library. Once you have it, export it as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export CDISC_PRIMARY_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

4.  **Fetch the canonical CRF data:**
    This command crawls the CDISC Library and creates a canonical `crf.json` file.
    ```bash
    poetry run scripts/build_canonical.py -o crf.json
    ```

5.  **Generate all CRF artifacts:**
    This command reads the `crf.json` file and generates the CRF documents in multiple formats (Markdown, DOCX, CSV, etc.) inside the `artefacts/` directory.
    ```bash
    poetry run scripts/build.py --source crf.json --outdir artefacts
    ```

6.  **View the generated files:**
    The generated artifacts are now in the `artefacts/` directory. You can open them to see the results. For example, on macOS, you could run:
    ```bash
    open artefacts/VS.docx
    ```
## Development Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Setup scripts are provided for different operating systems.

### Linux and macOS

Run the setup script from your shell:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will:
1.  Check for `python3` (3.11+) and `poetry`.
2.  If they are not found, it will attempt to install them using the system's package manager (`apt`, `yum`, or `brew`).
3.  Install all project dependencies.
4.  Set up pre-commit hooks.

### Windows

Run the PowerShell setup script from a PowerShell terminal. You may need to adjust your execution policy first:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
./setup.ps1
```

The script will:
1.  Check for Python 3.11+ and Poetry.
2.  If they are not found, it will download and install them. This may require administrator privileges.
3.  Install all project dependencies.
4.  Set up pre-commit hooks.
> **Note:** If Python or Poetry are installed by the script, you will need to restart your terminal and run the script again for the changes to take effect.

### Docker-based Environment (Recommended)

For the most consistent and reliable setup, you can use the provided development container. This avoids any "works on my machine" issues.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [VS Code Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

**To get started:**
1.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
2.  A notification will appear asking if you want to "Reopen in Container". Click it.
3.  VS Code will build the Docker image and start the development container. This may take a few minutes on the first run.

Once inside the dev container, you'll have a fully configured environment with all tools and dependencies ready to go. You can use the integrated terminal in VS Code to run tests, scripts, etc.

## Generating CDASH CRFs

The repository includes `scripts/generate_cdash_crf.py` which converts the
official CDASH workbooks into Word documentsâ€”one per domain.  The script now
adds extra metadata from the IG such as variable type, controlled terminology
and completion instructions.  Generated CRFs use a consistent landscape layout
with protocol information in the header and versioned footers with page numbers.
`pandas`, `python-docx` and `openpyxl` are already listed in the project
dependencies.

```bash
python scripts/generate_cdash_crf.py \
    --model CDASH_Model_v1.3.xlsx \
    --ig CDASHIG_v2.3.xlsx \
    --out ./crfs

# To build only specific domains
python scripts/generate_cdash_crf.py --model CDASH_Model_v1.3.xlsx \
    --ig CDASHIG_v2.3.xlsx --domains AE CM
```

Edit `build_domain_crf()` in the script to customise the table layout or add
study branding or adjust fonts and orientation if needed.
