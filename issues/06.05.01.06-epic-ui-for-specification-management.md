### Description

Develop a user interface for managing dataset specifications. This will include forms for:
- Generating Excel-based specification templates (`spec generate-template`).
- Generating synthetic datasets from a specification file (`spec generate-dataset`).
- Validating a dataset against a specification file (`spec validate`).

### Proposed Implementation

1.  **Refactor CLI:** Refactor the `spec generate-template`, `spec generate-dataset`, and `spec validate` commands to extract their core logic into reusable functions.
2.  **Add API Endpoints:** Create three new API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/spec/generate-template`, `POST /api/spec/generate-dataset`, `POST /api/spec/validate`). The dataset generation and validation endpoints will need to handle file uploads for the spec/dataset files.
3.  **Update Frontend:** Add a new "Specification Management" section to the UI with three distinct forms for each function. The forms for dataset generation and validation will require file input fields.
4.  **Update Frontend Script:** Add JavaScript to handle the three new forms, including file uploads via `FormData`.
5.  **Add Tests:** Add new unit tests for each of the three API endpoints.

### Acceptance Criteria

- A user can see a "Specification Management" section in the web UI.
- The UI contains three separate forms: one for generating a template, one for generating a dataset from a spec, and one for validating a dataset against a spec.
- **Generate Template:** The user can specify a product, version, and domains, and receive a downloadable Excel specification file.
- **Generate Dataset:** The user can upload a specification file and receive a downloadable package of generated dataset files (e.g., a zip file of CSVs).
- **Validate Dataset:** The user can upload a specification file and a dataset file, and see a validation report in the UI.
- The existing `spec` CLI subcommands continue to function correctly.
