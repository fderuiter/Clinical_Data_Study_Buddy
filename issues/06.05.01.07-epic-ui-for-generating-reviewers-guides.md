### Description

Develop a user interface for generating Analysis Data Reviewer's Guides (ADRG) and Study Data Reviewer's Guides (SDRG). This will provide a UI for the `adrg generate` and `sdrg generate` commands.

### Proposed Implementation

1.  **Refactor CLI:** Refactor the `adrg generate` and `sdrg generate` commands to extract their core logic into reusable functions.
2.  **Add API Endpoints:** Create two new API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/generate-adrg`, `POST /api/generate-sdrg`). These endpoints will need to handle file uploads for the `crf.json` and `study_config.json` files.
3.  **Update Frontend:** Add a "Generate Reviewer's Guides" section to the UI with a form that can be used for both ADRG and SDRG generation. The form will need a way to select the guide type and provide the necessary input files.
4.  **Update Frontend Script:** Add JavaScript to handle the file uploads and API calls for both guide types.
5.  **Add Tests:** Add new unit tests for both API endpoints.

### Acceptance Criteria

- A user can see a "Generate Reviewer's Guides" section in the web UI.
- The user can select whether to generate an ADRG or an SDRG.
- The user can upload a `crf.json` file and a `study_config.json` file.
- After clicking "Generate", the user receives a downloadable `.docx` file of the requested guide.
- The existing `adrg generate` and `sdrg generate` CLI commands continue to function correctly.
