### Description

This Theme represents the strategic goal of expanding the project's scope from a CRF generator to a more comprehensive clinical data generation tool, inspired by the feature list in `TODO.old.md` (Phase 15). It covers synthetic dataset generation, document/template generation, and supporting utilities like a REST API.

This item was migrated from `TODO.old.md`.
