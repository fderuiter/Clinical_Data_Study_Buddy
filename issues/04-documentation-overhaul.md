### Description

The project's documentation is a mix of a very long `README.md` and a few scattered files in the `docs/` directory. While the `README.md` is comprehensive, its length makes it difficult to navigate. The project would benefit from a more structured and user-friendly documentation system.

### Proposed Solution

1.  **Restructure the `README.md`:**
    *   Shorten the main `README.md` to be a concise overview of the project.
    *   It should include a brief description, a quickstart guide, and links to the more detailed documentation.

2.  **Expand the `docs/` Directory:**
    *   The `docs/` directory should be the central place for all detailed documentation.
    *   It should be structured into logical sections, for example:
        *   **User Guide:** Detailed instructions on how to use the new CLI, with examples for each command.
        *   **Developer Guide:** Information for developers, including setup instructions, architectural overview, and guidelines for contributing.
        *   **API Reference:** Documentation for the public API of the Python packages (if any).

3.  **Implement `mkdocs`:**
    *   The project already has `mkdocs` as a dependency, but it's not fully utilized.
    *   Create a `mkdocs.yml` configuration file to define the site structure and navigation.
    *   Convert the existing documentation into a format suitable for `mkdocs`.

4.  **Improve Code-level Documentation:**
    *   Review and improve docstrings in the code, especially for the new CLI commands and the refactored modules.
    *   Ensure that docstrings follow a consistent format (e.g., Google style or reStructuredText).

### Acceptance Criteria

-   The main `README.md` is a concise and easy-to-read overview.
-   The `docs/` directory contains a well-structured and comprehensive set of documentation.
-   The documentation is served by `mkdocs` and is easy to navigate.
-   Code-level documentation (docstrings) is improved and consistent.
