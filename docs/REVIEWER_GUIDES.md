# Generating Reviewer's Guides

This document provides a detailed explanation of the process for generating the Analysis Data Reviewer's Guide (ADRG) and the Study Data Reviewer's Guide (SDRG).

## Overview

The ADRG and SDRG are important documents for regulatory submissions to the FDA. They provide context and traceability for the analysis and study data, respectively. The scripts in this project are designed to automate the generation of these documents based on the PHUSE templates.

## ADRG Generation

The `scripts/generate_adrg.py` script generates the ADRG. The script uses the following data sources:

- **`crf.json`**: This file contains the canonical CRF data, including metadata about the ADaM datasets. It is generated by the `scripts/build_canonical.py` script.
- **`study_config.json`**: This file contains study-specific information, such as the study ID, protocol ID, and protocol title.

The generated ADRG document includes the following sections:

1.  **Introduction**: Provides a brief overview of the study and the purpose of the ADRG.
2.  **Protocol Description**: Describes the study protocol.
3.  **Analysis Datasets**: Lists the ADaM datasets included in the submission.
4.  **Data Conformance**: Describes the conformance of the analysis datasets to the CDISC ADaM standard.
5.  **Program and Macro Catalog**: Provides a catalog of the programs and macros used to create the analysis datasets.
6.  **Data Listings**: Provides information about the data listings included in this submission.
7.  **Figures and Tables**: Provides information about the figures and tables included in this submission.

## SDRG Generation

The `scripts/generate_sdrg.py` script generates the SDRG. The script uses the same data sources as the ADRG generation script.

The generated SDRG document includes the following sections:

1.  **Introduction**: Provides a brief overview of the study and the purpose of the SDRG.
2.  **Protocol Description**: Describes the study protocol.
3.  **List of Included Documents**: Lists the documents included in the submission package.
4.  **Data Collection and Processing**: Describes how the data was collected and processed.
5.  **SDTM Datasets**: Lists the SDTM datasets included in the submission.
6.  **Data Conformance**: Describes the conformance of the study data to the CDISC SDTM standard.
7.  **Appendices**: Contains any appendices.

## Regional Standards

### EMA

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) does not have a direct equivalent of the SDRG/ADRG. However, they require the submission of the Common Technical Document (CTD), which includes the following documents that serve a similar purpose:

-   **Module 2.5: Clinical Overview**
-   **Module 2.7: Clinical Summary**

Generating these documents is a more complex task and is not yet supported by this project.

### NMPA

The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China is in the process of adopting CDISC standards. At this time, there are no clear requirements for reviewer's guides.
