# Generating CDASH CRFs

The repository includes a command to convert the official CDASH workbooks into Word documentsâ€”one per domain.  The command now adds extra metadata from the IG such as variable type, controlled terminology and completion instructions.  Generated CRFs use a consistent landscape layout with protocol information in the header and versioned footers with page numbers.

```bash
poetry run cdisc generate-cdash-crf --ig-version v2.3 --out ./crfs

# To build only specific domains
poetry run cdisc generate-cdash-crf --ig-version v2.3 --domains AE CM --out ./crfs
```
