# Generating CDASH CRFs

The repository includes a command to convert the official CDASH workbooks into Word documentsâ€”one per domain.  The command now adds extra metadata from the IG such as variable type, controlled terminology and completion instructions.  Generated CRFs use a consistent landscape layout with protocol information in the header and versioned footers with page numbers.

```bash
poetry run cdsb generate cdash-crf --ig-version "v2.3" --out-dir ./crfs

# To build only specific domains
poetry run cdsb generate cdash-crf --ig-version "v2.3" --domains AE CM --out-dir ./crfs
```
